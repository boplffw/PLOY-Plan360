        2. Acceptance as a Planner
        <br>  
        <br>
        Any individual or company who is able to enter into a legally binding and enforceable contract may apply to become a PLOY Planner.

        PLOY may make use of a third-party verification service in order to perform background checks. These services may verify information such as name, address, social security number, and criminal background.
        <br>  
        <br>
        The success of the PLOY concept is based on the quality of the experience that You as a Planner deliver. Therefore we are highly selective in the people we choose to work with.
        <br>  
        <br>
        PLOY only accepts local planners, meaning our Planners’ residential address should be the same location that they are applying for, and our Planners are only permitted to take orders for such locations. 
        <br>  
        <br>
        We are committed to the success of our Planners. Therefore, we may not accept additional Planners in a particular area if we feel that the demand is satisfied by existing Planners. Acceptance as a Planner is at the sole discretion of PLOY and we reserve the right to refuse anyone for any reason.
